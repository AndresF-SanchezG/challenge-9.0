# Calculator

The created web calculator combines an interactive HTML design with a set of JavaScript functions to provide an intuitive calculation interface. The HTML interface presents an organized structure that includes sections for displaying entered numbers, operators, and operation results.

The calculator's functionality is achieved through a series of events and actions handled by the JavaScript code. Numeric buttons allow users to input numbers, which are stored in an array for subsequent processing. The delete button removes the last entered number.

The calculator also allows the selection of arithmetic operators such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Clicking an operator, the JavaScript code stores previously entered numbers and the selected operator for performing calculations.

The operaciones() function in the JavaScript code executes mathematical operations based on the selected operator, using the stored numbers. Results are updated on the display screen.

To clear entered numbers or completely reset the calculator, specific buttons are provided. The "CE" button clears numbers from the current operation, while the "C" button completely resets the calculator.

The equal button calculates and displays the result of the current operation, based on the entered numbers and selected operator. If only one number has been entered, that number is displayed as the result.

Overall, the calculator provides an easy way to perform basic mathematical calculations using an intuitive interface and editing and calculation functionalities implemented with JavaScript.
